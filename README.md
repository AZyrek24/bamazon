Bamazon is a mock online store in which a user can purchase items from a list by following some prompts in the terminal. Making a purchase displays a customer total.

Bamazon Manager allows a user to view the current inventory, view inventory that is low in quantity (less than 5), add inventory back into the database, and add new items into the inventory database.

Bamazon and Bamazon manager connects node.js with a mysql database in order to send and receive data in real time; it showcases the following concepts:

* Node.js server creation
* MySQLWorkbench database
* Node packages (inquirer, mysql, colors)
